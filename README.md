# face2comics by Sxela (Alex Spirin)
## This is a paired face to comics dataset, which can be used to train pix2pix or similar networks.
This dataset contains a lot of crappy nightmare-fuelish samples, which tend to be useful for full image to comic convertion, as they teach models how to trace something if it's not a face.
